<summary>Work / Project Examples</summary>

## InStock Project

- It is an Inventory Management System app.
- I was responsible for attributing the front-end and back-end tickets to my teammates using Jira for this group project. We set a meeting and decided who would feel more comfortable doing each task.
- For the back-end, I did the delete routes for the API, and also, our group did pair programing to do the edit route.
- For the front-end, I did the react routes, I did the Warehouses and Warehouses Details pages, where I had to fetch the data and do the responsive design. Besides that, I also did the responsive design of the Inventory page and helped my teammate finish the Item Availability part of the "Add New Inventory Item" page.
- I also deployed the API and the App using Heroku.

  - _Note: If it does not open at the first try, git it a minute because free heroku dyno could be sleeping._
- Code is in a Private Repo.

## Advice App - Hackathon

- It's an app that gives random advice.
- My teammates and I built this app doing pair programming all the time. We did the API together and also the front-end.
- Communication was crucial to us during this hackathon so the group would deliver the app on time.
- I also deployed the API and the App using Heroku.

## Movies Search - Hackathon

- It's an app that gets movies information from The Movie Database API.
  We all tried to fetch the data from the API, and once I got it, my teammates and I built the logic part by doing pair programming most of the time.
- We finalized the style together, fixing some bugs and improving some styles.
- I did the like button and showed my teammates how to do it.
- The team had a great connection. We were able to do most of the work together and deliver the project on time.
- I also deployed the App using GitPages.

- Vanilla Javascript - specialist

I want a professional and deep experience with Javascript, mainly with Front-End, which is where I think I can help more, but also with Back-End as a Full Stack Developer.

### The Challenge

<details>
<summary>Create a menu for a "Fancy Italian Restaurant".</summary>

## 1. Sorting

- In `index.js`, loop over `menuItems` and categorize them into sections based on each items assigned `type`
- Sort the items in each category by their `menuOrder`

## 2. Rendering

- Render the sorted results into the appropriate container with `index.html`
- Format any prices. For example, 8.5 becomes \$8.50
- Render the "spicy" icon next to any menu items where `spicy` is `true`

## 3. Styling

- Add some "italian menu" styling to boost your stores sales. Use Google Images if you need inspiration.

## 4. BONUS: Filtering

- Add a checkbox to toggle spicy options. When the checkbox is checked, the spicy options should be visible. It should be checked by default.

## 5. BONUS: What You'd Change

- Create a new file called "TODO.md". Add any additional changes you'd recommend making if this was a project you were working on for a real client.
