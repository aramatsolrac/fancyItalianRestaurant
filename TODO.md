## TODO

- I decided to do the app using Vanilla JS and pure CSS to show my knowledge with the basics and also to be consistent with the given project. Still, I would redo the app using React.js because it is a well-known framework, and I believe it would be easier to do some components, which would make the code cleaner.
- I would also use Sass for styling and reuse some styles using mixins, with the same purpose, it would make the code cleaner and reusable.
- For a back-end, I would create an API to save all the menus and create some routes to add, delete, and edit the current menu to help the owner manage his website. Also, a route to send a reservation request.
- For the front-end, I would add a reservation section where I would add a form.
- Moreover, I would improve the slider in the hero section with I smother transition.
