<summary>Work / Project Examples</summary>

## InStock Project

- It is an Inventory Management System app.
- I was responsible for attributing the front-end and back-end tickets to my teammates using Jira for this group project. We set a meeting and decided who would feel more comfortable doing each task.
- For the back-end, I did the delete routes for the API, and also, our group did pair programing to do the edit route.
- For the front-end, I did the react routes, I did the Warehouses and Warehouses Details pages, where I had to fetch the data and do the responsive design. Besides that, I also did the responsive design of the Inventory page and helped my teammate finish the Item Availability part of the "Add New Inventory Item" page.
- I also deployed the API and the App using Heroku.
- [In Stock Live](https://instockproject.herokuapp.com/)
  - _Note: If it does not open at the first try, git it a minute because free heroku dyno could be sleeping._
- Code is in a Private Repo.

## Advice App - Hackathon

- It's an app that gives random advice.
- My teammates and I built this app doing pair programming all the time. We did the API together and also the front-end.
- Communication was crucial to us during this hackathon so the group would deliver the app on time.
- I also deployed the API and the App using Heroku.
- [Advice Generator App](https://advice-generator-project.herokuapp.com/)
  - _Note: If it does not open at the first try, git it a minute because free heroku dyno could be sleeping._

## Movies Search - Hackathon

- It's an app that gets movies information from The Movie Database API.
  We all tried to fetch the data from the API, and once I got it, my teammates and I built the logic part by doing pair programming most of the time.
- We finalized the style together, fixing some bugs and improving some styles.
- I did the like button and showed my teammates how to do it.
- The team had a great connection. We were able to do most of the work together and deliver the project on time.
- I also deployed the App using GitPages.

<summary>Inspiration</summary>
  
- [sweetalert2](https://github.com/sweetalert2/sweetalert2)
    - Open source JS library that helps us create stylized alerts pop up.
    - I have been using this on many of the projects I have worked on. I think is accessible, and easy to understand how to apply it in a project.

- [Exercism](https://exercism.org/)

  - Open source project to practice algorithm using many different languages
  - I have been using this to practice JS when I have time.
  - It is a great platform for those who are starting to learn a new programming language.

- Some articles that i found really helpful on my journey:

  - [Save states by local storage and life cycle method](https://tomoharutsutsumi.medium.com/save-states-by-local-storage-and-life-cycle-method-f7d0aaf0c11e)
  - [How to Deploy Your React App to Heroku
    ](https://betterprogramming.pub/how-to-deploy-your-react-app-to-heroku-aedc28b218ae)

- Women in the teach who are an inspiration for me:
  - [Opinionated React](https://opinionatedreact.com/)
    - Sara is the author of the book Opinionated React, she is one of the speakers at the React Summit 2022.
  - [Krystal Campioni](https://krystalcampioni.com/)
    - Krystal's website is a great inspiration for me because it is different from anything else I have ever seen, and one day I want to be able to build something like that.
  - It is very inspiring for me to see Brazilian women, like Sara and Krystal, doing a great job in the community.

<summary>Focus</summary>
I would like to focus my efforts on Javascript to have a good and deep understanding of the base language I would use on my day to day basis. I want to actively participate in projects and understand the team's strategies to make decisions on how to help our clients. Work with other teams such as UX/UI to become a better front-end developer but also have contact with the back-end so I will continue to work as a full-stack developer. If I was given the opportunity to have a mentor, I would love to have feedback, code reviews, documentation and set personal goals to improve myself and grow in the company.
